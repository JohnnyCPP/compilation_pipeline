# Compilation Pipeline

This repository contains a simple hello_world.c program, a Makefile with predefined targets, and supporting documentation.

Its purpose is to see how a program transforms from source code to machine code.

The Compilation Pipeline is the step-by-step process by which a high-level programming language is transformed into an executable binary that a computer can run.

It consists of several stages, each handled by a different tool: Preprocessor, Compiler, Assembler, and Linker.
